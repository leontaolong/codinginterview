## Preparation Strategy
Again, the purpose of this article is not for showing how to solve a specific coding problem. This is more close to a roadmap for preparing a code interview from writing resume to attending onsite interviews based my own experiences. I hope this strategy could help.

### Resume
Having a resume is the first thing you need to do when apply for a full time or intern job. As big name companies usually receive millions(#https://www.inc.com/michael-schneider/its-harder-to-get-into-google-than-harvard.html) of resumes every year, they will have some sort of machine/HR screening system to do the intial filtering based on keywords/gpa/school/major,etc. So this is quite important for one to have a resume that could pass the first round machine/HR resume screen.

#### Keywords
As some of you may know, if your resume is submitted as an internal referral, the machine screen may not apply to your resume but HR screen may also happen regardless your resume is an external or internal application. Most HR screen will follow a list of keywords and if your resume don't have them, you could be filtered out.Some people call this Buzzwords Screen. If you are looking for a CS related job,a resume with Electrical Engineering major is more like to be filtered out than a Electrical Engineering major with specialization in Computer Science or Computer Science Engineering. I know this sounds unfair as I met a lot of people with different majors doing great job in software development, but when they job market are crowded with appliers and the headcounts are limited, a company has to follow its rules to put CS major as first priority.

Knowing this fact, wording becomes a vital part of your resume.
- If your major is Computer Science related(Computer Science Engineering, Computer System Engingeering.....), be really really really explicit about your major. Don't use short names, printing ink is cheap.
- If Computer Science is your secondary or minor or specifications, still be explicit about it in the Major title part of your resume, having the word in your major title is much better than simply mentioning it in your course work.
- If your major has nothing to do with Computer Science but you are looking for one, metion what Computer Sciense/Software development work you have done in your course projects/job experiences/side projects,etc.

Here is a list of discussion about Buzz Words, take a look if you have time:

#### Education and Course Projects
For college students who don't have too many external working experiences(which will apply to everyone looking for their first job. Don't worry, nobody born with a software development job), education and course projects will play the biggest part of your resume unless you did lots of side projects.

No HR/Hiring manager is expecting a green college student to have experiences of building Facebook, don't be shy to mention your course projects in your resume even though it is just a team homework. Just keep in mind, it's more effective to mention your course projects than just the title and contents of the courses. Your resume is not a mini version of your college syllabus. You should spend more words on explaining what you have done in a course project instead of just showing a title of the work.

As long as you elaborate your work/contribution/learning from this project, it is valuable for them to know your background.
